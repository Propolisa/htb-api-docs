#### ❗ **NOTICE**:
> *I have started maintaining the API documentation via a Postman collection as it's simply more convenient, both to allow you to demo the API yourself, and for me to arrange everything in one place.*

## Postman Documentation Link:
Please find the current, 111+ endpoint documentation here:

## Welcome to the community documentation for the Hack The Box v4 API!
In celebration of the new API and site release, I am organizing available information about API endpoints and data types. I hope it will be helpful to the developers who want to create their own HTB-integrated tools (e.g. Discord bots, progress tracker, shortest-path-to-rank algorithm). Let me know what you make!
Pages in this wiki are organized according to the API structure. You may use the find feature to search for a specific method or functionality.

### Contributions
Contributions are very welcome! If you would like to be added as a contributor to the Postman project, please feel free to get in touch with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Propolis709) [![alt text][1.2]][1]

Happy Hacking 👋
