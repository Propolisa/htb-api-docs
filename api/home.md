# Hack The Box v4 API Community Documentation
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Propolisa/unofficial-htb-api-docs/master/static/img/banner.png" alt="" width="640px">

## Welcome to the community documentation for the Hack The Box v4 API!
In celebration of the new API and site release, I am organizing available information about API endpoints and data types. I hope it will be helpful to the developers who want to create their own HTB-integrated tools (e.g. Discord bots, progress tracker, shortest-path-to-rank algorithm). Let me know what you make!
Pages in this wiki are organized according to the API structure. You may use the find feature to search for a specific method or functionality.

### Contributions
Contributions are very welcome! If you know about an endpoint that's not listed here, or have a correction for the existing documentation, please feel free to get in touch with me or contribute directly to the wiki.

Happy Hacking ðŸ‘‹
